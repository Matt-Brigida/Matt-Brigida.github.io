I am a Professor of Finance and Chair of the Accounting and Finance Department at the [SUNY Polytechnic Institute](https://sunypoly.edu/).   You can find [my published research work on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CvW8NYUAAAAJ&hl=en), and by my [ORCID researcher identifier](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1937-2712).  My CV is also available above.  The *Working Paper* link above lists much of my work in progress.  Much of my present work is on topics related to the 2023 Regional Banking crisis. I also have projects the effect of ethical tuning on LLM risk-taking, the impact of noise in training deep neural networks, valuation of decentralized crypto exchanges, and electricity powers swaps.
