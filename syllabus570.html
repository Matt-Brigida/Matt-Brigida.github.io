<div id="description" class="section level2">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The assessment of financial techniques to determine how they affect
the business both internally and externally. The learning outcomes for
this course are summarized below:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Interpretation and analysis of financial data including: the time
value of money, ratios, and financial forecasting in order to help the
firm achieve its business objectives.</p></li>
<li><p>An understanding of capital budgeting and the cost of capital in
order to allocate scarce resources amongst business
opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p>To understand capital structure, and the methods of adjusting
such structure particularly through stock repurchases, dividends, and
security issuance.</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis of working capital in order to anticipate the future
cash flow of the firm.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="academic-honesty-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic Honesty Policy</h2>
<p>Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated in this class. Cheating on
quizzes, examinations, and other forms of dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism,
collusion, and falsification of data) will be dealt with in a serious
and formal manner. The penalty for academic dishonesty in this class
will be course failure. That is, any student who is found to be cheating
or engaged in other academically dishonest behavior will be failed for
this course for this semester. Course withdrawals to avoid such a
failure will not be permitted. As a student, you have a responsibility
to become familiar with the Academic Honesty Policy found in the Student
Rights, Regulations, and Procedures Handbook.</p>
</div>
<div id="online-office-hours" class="section level2">
<h2>Online Office Hours</h2>
<p>I will be logged on the course D2L site throughout the week, and I
will also periodically access the Discussion Forums.</p>
<p>Students do not need to access the course simultaneously, and
therefore have a measure of flexibility regarding when they access the
course. However, students should access the course regularly to keep up
with assignments, and to maintain a presence in the Discussion Room.
Students should also often check their Clarion University email
account.</p>
</div>
<div id="exams" class="section level2">
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>There will be two exams (a midterm and a final). The exams will
mainly be comprised of conceptual, and computation questions. Many of
the exam questions will be derived from the assigned end-of-chapter
questions, so you can prepare for the exam by completing all of the
end-of-chapter questions. Specifically, the discussion (<em>Concept
Questions</em>) are similar to the short answer questions, and the
<em>Optimal Homework</em> is similar to the computations.</p>
<p>While you are allowed to use your text during the exam, you should
not rely on it. Students perform considerably better if they know the
material beforehand, and only need to consult the text for a few
questions.</p>
<p>For each exam you will need:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Access to software which can display pdf files (I will send the
exam to you as a pdf).</p></li>
<li><p>A wordprocessor which can write pdf files (you will send your
short answer questions back to me as a pdf).</p></li>
<li><p>Spreadsheet software to answer the computation questions (you can
send me the spreadsheet as .xls or .xlsx).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Normally no make-up exams will be given. Failure to turn in an exam
will result in a grade of zero for the missed exam. Make-up exams will
only be allowed for <em>extraordinary</em> and <em>verifiable</em>
reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Mid-term Exam</strong></p>
<p>I will post the exam as a pdf file to D2L on the Wednesday before the
exam due date. You will have until the exam due date/time to submit the
mid-term exam. You will submit your exam using the Dropbox in D2L.</p>
<p><strong>Final Exam</strong></p>
<p>The final exam is concentrated on the topics learned after the
mid-term exam, so the exam is not comprehensive <em>per se</em>.
However, the concepts learned after the mid-term rely heavily those
tested in the mid-term, so a poor understanding of the material on the
mid-term will lead to a poor performance on the final exam.</p>
<p>Exactly like the mid-term, I will post the exam as a pdf file to D2L
on the Wednesday before the exam due date. You should upload your
completed exam to the D2L Dropbox by the due date/time.</p>
<p><strong>Exam Rules</strong></p>
<!-- I have provided the exam dates so that you can make sure that you will have time to take the exams on these dates. To be clear, this course needs to be prioritized ahead of work or other obligations on these two dates. Missing, or not completing an exam on time, means that you will receive a 0 for the exam.  Note, I will not give any `Incompletes' in this course.  If you feel you may not be able to take an exam on the specific date, you should immediately tell the instructor (within the first few days of the course), or you should not take this course.  -->
<p>You are not to discuss the exam with other students. Both receiving
help from another student, or helping another student on an exam, are
considered serious academic irregularities the result of which can range
from receiving an `F’ in the course to dismissal from the
university.</p>
<p><strong>You must complete and submit your computation questions in a
spreadsheet. If you submiy your computation answers in Word, I will
reduce your score. You should also not treat your spreadsheet as a Word
or text file. That is answers should be written as formulas, and not as
text strings.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If your spreadsheet is disorganized you will lose points. The
computations and answers should be easily found and understood by anyone
opening your spreadsheet. See the ‘Note on Spreadsheet Design’ at the
end of this syllabus.</strong> <!-- <center> --> <!-- % **PROJECT** -->
<!-- </center> -->
<!-- % In groups of no more than 4, you will value a tolling agreement on an electricity generating facility, or transmission line.  You will deliver your valuation to me in an well laid out spreadsheet.  A more detailed description of the project will be provided in the first few weeks of class. --></p>
<!-- % If you have questions on your project you are encouraged to post your spreadsheet so I and other students can help.  You learn a great deal by helping others, and by seeing how others approach the problem.  Also don't worry too much about another group copying you.  It is easy for me to tell when one spreadsheet has been copied from another.  Moreover, since you posted yours, it would be clear that you were the one copied off of, and the other group would receive the reduction in points.   -->
</div>
<div id="participation" class="section level2">
<h2>Participation</h2>
<p>There are two ways to satisfy the 40 participation points. You
can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take part in the weekly online discussion boards.</li>
<li>Submit 70 short questions and answers on Corporate Finance to
GitHub.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important: You can only complete (1) or (2). You cannot mix
the two. For instance, you cannot miss a week of the discussion board
and submit a few short questions and answers instead. You either submit
70 short answers or complete every discussion. As an example, if you
submit 60 of 70 short questions and answers, and complete 2 of the 7
discussions, you will receive <span class="math inline">\(\frac{60}{70}
= 85.71\%\)</span> as your participation score.</strong></p>
<p>The main difference between the two options is that for the weekly
discussion you must make your contributions each week, whereas you can
complete the short questions and answers anytime prior to the due date.
This latter option adds flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>1. DISCUSSION:</strong> For each week I have posted a set of
`Concept Questions’ from the text. You must choose 2 of the questions
from the set and post your answers to the discussion board. Try and
choose questions that has not yet been answered, but if all the
questions have been answered then try and add unique information in your
answer.</p>
<p>The subject line of your discussion post should be the in the format
[chapter].[question number]. For example, if you are answering question
5 from chapter 3, your subject line should be ‘5.3’. Also, be sure to
have one post for each answer. Don’t answer multiple questions in one
post.</p>
<p>In addition to your answer, you must post two responses to other
students’ answers. So each week you will post 2 answers, and 2 responses
to other answers, for a total of 4 posts to the discussion board each
week.</p>
<p>To receive credit your posts must be constructive, preferably
somewhat insightful, and show you have done the reading. If your post
does not meet the preceding criteria, please don’t bother posting it
because it will just clutter the discussion board. A particular week’s
discussion will conclude Sunday at 9pm of that week. Don’t post to the
week’s discussion after that date/time.</p>
<p><strong>2. Q/A:</strong> You should post finance related short
questions and answers similar to what you find at <a
href="https://github.com/finance-AI/data/blob/master/studentQA/studentQA_fall_2016.txt"
class="uri">https://github.com/finance-AI/data/blob/master/studentQA/studentQA_fall_2016.txt</a>.
These are submission from an earlier class. You should submit your Q/A
in the same format.</p>
<p>This assignment will help you learn our Corporate Finance material by
writing concise answers to finance questions. In addition, your
submitted Q/A will be used to train a finance Artificial Intelligence. I
will feed the Q/A into a deep neural network to train a chatbot that can
answer finance questions—think Siri for finance.</p>
<p>I have created a file for Q/A for this course <a
href="https://github.com/finance-AI/data/blob/master/studentQA/studentQA_570_winter_2017.txt">https://github.com/finance-AI/data/blob/master/studentQA/studentQA_570_winter_2017.txt</a>.
Submit your Q/A there. Adding to the file is easy—<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVC9UKkaiko">see this video for a
short tutorial</a>, and <a
href="https://github.com/FinancialMarkets/5MinuteFinance/commit/8f12f63b546a80fdb04e787514d967f1a1c0725f">This
is an example of a link to a commit.</a></p>
<p>If your GitHub username is similar to your real name, then you don’t
have to tell me you have submitted the Q/A (I’ll see it). If your
username is different, then send me an email from your clarion email
address with the Subject “FIN 570 Q/A” letting me know your real name
and GitHub username. Note, GitHub shows how many lines you have added,
so there is no need to number your questions. Also, don’t label the
questions and answers.</p>
</div>
<div id="homeworkpop-quizzesother-participation" class="section level2">
<h2>Homework/Pop Quizzes/Other Participation</h2>
<p>Throughout the semester I <strong>may</strong> assign brief
homeworks, or unannounced in-class quizzes. The nature of these is
usually to highlight an important point, or give the class extra
practice on certain material. You start with 10 final grade points, and
your points are reduced the more you get incorrect. However, for
example, if I only assign two points of homework and no quizzes or other
assignments, then you receive 8 points no matter what, and the remaining
2 points depend on the correctness of you answers.</p>
</div>
<div id="optional-homework" class="section level2">
<h2>Optional Homework</h2>
<p>I will post a set of optional homework questions. These are
end-of-chapter problems to be done in a spreadsheet. The questions are
very much like the spreadsheet problems which will be on the exam. Also,
on the exams you may use the spreadsheets that <em>you</em> created to
complete the optional homework questions. Do not copy from another
student’s spreadsheet however.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-communication" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Communication</h2>
<p>All communication will be through D2L and email. If you have question
you are strongly encouraged to post it to a discussion forum instead of
emailing me. This way, other students can get the benefit of the
question and answer. It also saves me from answering the same question
many times via email, and frees me up to answer more questions and
generally provide more effective instruction for you.</p>

<h2>General Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>All times referred to in this course are Eastern Standard—unless
otherwise indicated.</li>
<li>Attending the class, online discussion, and reading the text is
required.</li>
<li>There will be no make up exams or extra points assignments.</li>
<li>Cheating will result in prosecution to the fullest extent possible
under university rules.</li>
<li>You are responsible for material covered in the online discussion,
as well as text material.</li>
<li><strong>Internet Access:</strong> This course requires that you have
regular access to the internet to submit work. You should not take this
course if you plan on being in an area with insufficient internet
access. ``My internet was down’’ is not an acceptable reason to hand in
late work.</li>
<li><strong>Adding or Dropping the Course:</strong> To add or drop the
course the student should consult the university guidelines and
withdrawal dates. The course instructor is not involved in a student’s
adding or withdrawing from the course.</li>
<li><strong>Software:</strong> You will need word processing and
spreadsheet software to take this course. Common examples of such
software are Microsoft Word and Excel. However, there is no need to buy
this software if you don’t already have it. There are many free
(open-source) alternatives which are just as good (and which allow you
to save/read files as .doc(x), .pdf, and .xls(x)). Some widely used free
office suites are LibreOffice (<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org"
class="uri">http://www.libreoffice.org</a>) and OpenOffice (<a
href="http://www.openoffice.org"
class="uri">http://www.openoffice.org</a>). Feel free to download and
use these. <em>In this course all word processed submissions should be
in .pdf, and all spreadsheets should be submitted as .xlsx.</em></li>

<h2>Tentative Outline</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>December 18: Chapters 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4</p></li>
<li><p>December 25 : Chapter 4, 5, &amp; 6</p></li>
<li><p>January 1: Chapters Section 7.3, &amp; 10</p></li>
<li><p>January 8: Chapters 11, 13 (see note*), &amp; 15</p></li>
<li><p>January 15: Chapters 16 &amp; 17</p></li>
</ul>
<p>*Chp. 13 requires you to calculate the yield-to-maturity (YTM) on a
bond, which is a topic from FIN 370 and chapter 8 of the present text.
However, YTM is nothing more than the annualized internal rate of return
(IRR) (we cover IRR in chapter 5 of the text) of the bond. So list the
cash flows of the bond and apply Excel’s IRR() function. Annualize the
IRR by multiplying the value by the number of periods in a year.</p>

<div id="a-note-on-spreadsheet-design" class="section level2">
<h2>A Note on Spreadsheet Design</h2>
<p>You should construct your spreadsheet as if you were an analyst at a
company, and you were going to submit the spreadsheet to upper
management. Therefore, getting the correct answer can be considered the
minimal amount of work. The spreadsheet should be easily readable and
organized. There are a couple of reasons why this is important: (1)
management often will check some numbers (or maybe change a few inputs
if they have more up to date information) and it will reflect very
poorly on you if they have to search around through a muddled and
ill-conceived spreadsheet; and (2) anyone should be able to pick up your
spreadsheet and complete it if you are not there (vacation, sick, or
hopefully promoted). Following are a couple tips on spreadsheet design,
though it is far from exhaustive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard-code as little as possible. You want a few cells for your
inputs, or a place where you put your data, and then every other cell is
linked and feeds off of these input cells. This way, to update your
spreadsheet you simply change the inputs or drop in new data.<br />
</li>
<li>Take the time to label cells, and put in appropriate comments if
necessary - though comments should not be used excessively. Also, it is
common to change the cell color depending on whether it is hard-coded
(an input) or a formula. This way you (or anyone else) can immediately
look at a cell and tell whether it is one in which you can type (an
input). Don’t forget to include a key.</li>
<li>It is often better to add tabs to a spreadsheet than continue
calculations on one tab. You can easily page through spreadsheet tabs
with <code>Ctrl+Shift' and</code>Page-up’ or `Page-down’.<br />
</li>
<li>Pivot tables. While we probably won’t need them in this course, you
should nonetheless get to know them. Pivot tables are incredibly useful
for summarizing data, and it is very possible you will be asked in an
interview whether you are familiar with them. Similarly, get to know
VLOOKUP.</li>
<li>If you are inputting a long formula, then break the calculation into
multiple cells. This makes it much easier to tell where a mistake was
made - and everyone always spends a fair amount of time looking for
errors.</li>
<li>Excel has many built in formulas which can be useful, however it is
important that you understand what the formula is doing to use them.
Blindly applying a formula can lead to trouble. For example, if you use
the IRR() function on cash flows with multiple roots, the formula will
return the first root it finds without signaling to you that there are
other roots. Also, there are Excel formulas that are flat out incorrect
- in particular the NPV() function. So, use a function if it saves time,
but first be sure you know what the function is doing and verify it
works. That said, in my experience it is better (and faster) to input
your own formula instead of using Excel’s. You often have to break the
calculation into a couple of steps, but this can be done quickly, and
the result is a spreadsheet that you know works and is easily
auditable.</li>
